## **Description**

There are two files that do the same job. You can choose whether you'd like the program to speak or not. By choosing `with_voice.py`, The program will print the result and say it. But if you want the printed result only you can run the other file `without_voice.py`. Also I want to make a note that you can run `without_voice.py` file without installing the packages above

The idea of this project is very simple, in Egypt we have 2 classes of trains. So by giving your ticket type and your seat number you get whether you are going to be beside a window or not  

These images will illustrate everything
